                          watch cooking shows all the time and you know 
                          what to do! After what felt like forever, the kitchen is a mess
                          but the cookies are done.
            <p>
                          Cooking took a lot of work and you don't want 
                          to clean up but you know the mess would upset your 
                          mom. What do you do?
